### What is this?

This is a historical linguistics wiki. It contains 
1. *theoretical* definitions for specific mechanisms of sound change
2. *practical* examples of language change which use the above mechanisms. The ultimate goal is to have a definition for each language change seen in practice, and likewise a practical example for each definition.

#### Note
This project is intended to be a way for me to formalize examples and definitions seen in a classroom setting, as a helpful web reference, and as a way to build intuition about language change.  The terminology here may be unconventional.
