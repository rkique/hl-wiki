Palatalization is a form of [[Partial Assimilation]] where a sound is pronounced with the palate. It generally occurs in consonants before the vowels i and j, which is are front vowels. This causes the preceding sound to be pronounced with the palate.

### Examples

- In English, the phrases *what are you* and *did you* are frequently pronounced *watcha* and *didja*, reflecting the following palatalizations:
	- ty > [tʃ] 
	- dy [dj] > [dʒ]
- Similarly, the pronounciation of *nature* and *picture* reflect palatalization:
	-  ty > [tʃ] neɪtyur > neɪtʃə
- We also see
	- k > tʃ, t > tʃ, s > ʃ before i, j
	- kin: > tʃin (palatalization of k before front unrounded vowels)
