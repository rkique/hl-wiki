Palatalization is a form of [[Partial Assimilation]] where a sound is pronounced with the palate. It generally occurs in consonants before the vowels i and j, which is are front vowels. This causes the preceding sound to be pronounced with the palate.

Some examples:
k > tʃ, t > tʃ, s > ʃ before i, j  
ty > [tʃ] dy [dj] > [dʒ] (watcha, didja, nature, picture)  
kin: > tʃin (palatalization of k before front unrounded vowels)
