## Splits follow Mergers

Here is an example illustrating why the plural for *mouse* is *mice*, and also demonstrating the principle of splits following mergers.

In the beginning, the Proto-Germanic *mus* (single) and *musi* (plural) were predictable variants of one another: to go from one to several, simply insert an *i*:

mus / musi 

Then, umlaut caused *musi* to become *mysi*, the *i* sound drawing the *u* up to *y*. At this point, the *u* in *mus* and the *y* in *mysi* are still variants of one another. Given a singular *mus*, *mysi* was just how you would pronounce *musi*, under the effect of umlaut.

Umlaut
mus / mysi

It was the subsequent deletion of *i* (merger with zero) which caused the two forms to vary only by having either an *u*, or an *y*. Listeners came to distinguish the two words only by this quality, so that *mus* and *mys* became phonemically distinct entities. 

loss of word-final *i*
mus / mys

This illustrates a split following a merger. The only way for a split to occur -- that is, for a sound to go from being a predictable, conditioned variant of another, to being a strange, different, new thing -- is if a merger eliminates the conditioning environment.
