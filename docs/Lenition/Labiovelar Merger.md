Labiovelar merger is a form of [[Lenition/index | lenition]]. It occurs when a labiovelar sound simplifies to a labial / velar with the same manner of articulation.

### Examples

In Welsh and other members of ‘P-Celtic’ PIE, \*kw became p.  This is a form of [[Fusion]], because it maintains the stop quality of k, and the place of articulation for \*w. 

Likewise, PTG \*p became Guarani, Sirionó kw, the velar quality of *w backing the \*p, and Proto-Oceanic \*mw became Proto-Polynesian \*ŋ.
