Voicing and devoicing are common forms of sound change. When consonants become voiced, it is interpreted as [[Lenition/index |lenition]], a weakening or decline in strength. This is because vowels are naturally voiced, so consonant voicing is seen as giving in to pressures to become more vowel-like. On the other hand, consonant devoicing can be seen as [[Fortition/index |fortition]].

### Examples
- between vowels (V_V).
	- Latin *lupu* > *lubo*.
- at the end of words:
	- [[Old French to Modern French]] t > d

# Devoicing

Devoicing is a common form of sound change, especially at the end of words. 
b > p
d > t
g > k

### Examples
1. German final-devoicing occurs word-finally and syllable finally.
2. Kaqchikel (Mayan) sonorants *l, r, w, j* become voiceless at the ends of words.
