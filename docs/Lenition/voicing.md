Voicing is a common form of sound change.

It takes several forms:
- between vowels (V_V).
	- Latin *lupu* > *lubo*.
- at the end of words:
	- [[Old French to Modern French]] t > d

[[Devoicing]] can also happen at the end of words.

When consonants become voiced, it is usually [[lenition]], a weakening or decline in strength. This is because vowels are naturally voiced, so consonant voicing is seen as giving in to pressures to become more vowel-like.
