There are two main causes of sound change, regular and analogical change. [[Sturtevant's paradox]] says that sound change is a regular process that causes irrregularities, while analogy is irregular but causes regularity.

There are a few categories of sound change that occur commonly. These include the insertion of a new sound, the strengthening or weakening of an existing sound, and the deletion of a sound.

[[fortition]]
[[lenition]]

Changes to multiple sounds also happen:

[[metathesis]]
[[compensatory lengthening]]
