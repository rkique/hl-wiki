Rhotacism refers to consonants changing to *r*. 

An example of this can be seen in old Latin, *honos* is the nominative singular form. We first see an intervocalic change from s > r, and then the regularization across verb forms.

| Nom Sg | Acc Sg | Gen. Sg |  |  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| honos | honos-i | honos-is | original form |  |
| honor | honos-i | honos-is | intervocalic s > r |  |
| honor | honor-i | honor-is | analogy |  |

This example demonstrates of [[Sturtevant's paradox]]. The conditioned sound change *s > r* occurs regularly across the language, however it introduces an irregularity within the 'honor' verb form. This irregularity is then smoothed out by the process of analogy, where the most used form of the word forces the others to conform to it.
