The changes from Old French to Modern French crucially involved [[final s-deletion]],  [[l-vocalization]] and [[monophthongization]].  Along with [[deaffrication]], [[vowel deletion]], and stop deletion, this resulted in shorter and more simple pronunciations.

The changes occurred in the following order:

1. [[Vowel raising]] before non-sonorant consonants
2. [[deletion | s-deletion]] before /t/
3. [[l-vocalization]] before consonants
4. t-[[Voicing | voicing]]
5. [[deaffrication]]
6. word-final non-dorsal stop deletion
7. unstressed [[vowel deletion]]

It's important that l-vocalization comes before final s-deletion, because otherwise words like sjɛls > sjø 'heavens' do not have l followed by a consonant. Then, the l is never vocalized to *u*, and the ɛu is never monophthongized to *ø*.
