### What is this?

This is a historical linguistics wiki. It contains 
1. *theoretical* definitions for specific mechanisms of sound change
2. *practical* examples of language change which use the above mechanisms. The ultimate goal is to have a definition for each language change seen in practice, and likewise a practical example for each definition.

!!! Info
    This project is intended to be a way for me to formalize examples and definitions seen in a classroom setting, as a helpful web reference, and as a way to build intuition about language change.  The terminology here may be unconventional.

### Kinds of Sound Change

There are two main causes of sound change, regular and analogical change. [[Sturtevant's paradox]] says that sound change is a regular process that causes irrregularities, while analogy is irregular but causes regularity.

There are a few categories of sound change that occur commonly. These include the insertion of a new sound, the strengthening or weakening of an existing sound, and the deletion of a sound.

[[Deletion/index | Deletion]]
[[Lenition/index | Lenition]]
[[Fortition/index | Fortition]]
[[Insertion/index | Insertion]]

Changes to multiple sounds also happen:

[[metathesis]]
[[compensatory lengthening]]
