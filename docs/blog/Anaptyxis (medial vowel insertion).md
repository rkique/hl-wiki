Anaptyxis is where an extra vowel is inserted between two consonants.

One example in English is the pronounciation of *athlete* as *aeθəlit*, inserting an extra *ə* after the *th* sound.

In dialects of Finnish, vowels are copied to proceeding consonant clusters. To be specific, in Eastern dialects of Finnish, after the first stressed syllable, a short copy of the preceding vowel is added between the consonants in the next consonant cluster. This only happens when the cluster begins with a resonant (*l* or *r*): 


Standard Finnish, Eastern Dialect

nelja, neleja (four)
kolme, kolome (three)
pilkku, pilikku (comma, dot)
jalka, jalaka (foot, leg)
kylma, kylyma (cold)
silma, silima (eye)
