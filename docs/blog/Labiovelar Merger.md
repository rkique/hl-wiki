Labiovelar merger is a form of lenition. It occurs when a labiovelar sound simplifies to a labial / velar with the same manner of articulation.

One example is in Welsh and other members of ‘P-Celtic’ PIE where \*kw became p. 

This is a form of [[Fusion]], because it main

maintains the stop quality of k, and the place of articulation for \*w. Likewise, PTG \pw became Guarani, Sirionó kw, the velar quality of *w evidently backing the *p, and Proto-Oceanic *mw became Proto-Polynesian *ŋ. In other Oceanic languages, however, *m and *mw merged as m, and less commonly *mw became w.
