Partial assimilation is assimilation where a sound becomes identical to a neighboring sound. 

Proto-Indo-European, Latin
*swep-no* > *somnus*

This is a partial change because the *p* only takes part of the conditioning environment, the nasality of the *n*. It is also a case of [[nasal assimilation]]
