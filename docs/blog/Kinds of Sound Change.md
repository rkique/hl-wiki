There are two main causes of sound change, regular and analogical change. [[Sturtevant's paradox]] says that sound change is a regular process that causes irrregularities, while analogy is irregular but causes regularity.

There are generally four kinds of sound change, the insertion of a new sound, the strengthening of a sound, the weakening of a sound, or the deletion of a sound.

[[insertion]]
[[fortition]]
[[lenition]]
[[deletion]]

These also combine in the following interesting ways:

[[metathesis]]
[[compensatory lengthening]]
